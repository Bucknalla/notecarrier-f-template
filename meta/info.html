<h1>Notecarrier F Shield - Expansion Board</h1>
<h2>Expansion Board</h2>
This project is a template of an expansion shield for the
<a href="https://shop.blues.com/products/notecarrier-f" target="blank">Notecarrier F</a>
<br><br>
This project includes a PCB edge defined as the same size as the Notecarrier F's generic pinouts with the connectors placed correctly to align the two boards. All IO present on the Notecarrier F's generic pinouts are connected to the project through 0.1" expansion headers.
<br><br>
The design allows for communication with both the attached Notecard and a Feather Microcontroller. Add your own sensors, actuators and other peripherals to the template to create your own custom Notecarrier F Shields.
